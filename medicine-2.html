    <p class="information">The Medical, Eye & Dental International Care Organization (MEDICO) promotes and provides
        health care in poor, rural communities in Central America where such care is extremely limited or not available.
        We sponsor clinical teams consisting of international and local medical, dental and vision care providers,
        nurses, and lay volunteers to operate temporary field clinics. MEDICO promotes public health by providing
        community health education and by sponsoring professional training of local providers. We organize and fund
        community improvements including the repair, renovation or building of village clinics, water systems and
        schools. MEDICO is an independent non-profit organization made up almost entirely of volunteers. We are not
        affiliated or allied with any political group or religious organization.</p>

            <p class="medicine-info">MEDICO’s work is accomplished by volunteers. That might mean anything from
                volunteer work in the United States to treating patients in a remote village in Honduras. Our volunteers
                help organize and teach classes, and they work out the logistics of building clinics and schools.
                Equally vital are our donors who support MEDICO's mission efforts in Central America. It takes a team to
                make our work happen.</p>

        <p class="map-info">MEDICO’s current programs are centered in Honduras. We have worked in Honduras for over 30
            years. The population of Honduras is approximately 10 million, of which nearly 15% of the people live on
            less than US $1.90 a day. While the Honduran health care system is staffed for the most part by competent,
            caring and compassionate professionals, they are simply overwhelmed by the need, especially in rural areas.
            In comparison, even the smallest fee takes medical, dental or vision care out of reach of most people. In
            the more remote areas of the country, such as Gracias a Dios in the east, there are no roads, so even
            transport to medical care is impossible, even if such care existed. MEDICO works directly with communities.
            Our assessment teams along with the Ministry of Health locate communities where the need is most critical.
            We select communities able and willing to work collaboratively with us. What do they need? How can we help?
            What can we do together? This is often a MEDICO/Honduran medical-dental-vision care team. It might be
            community classes on family planning, nutrition, or sanitation. It might be repairs or upgrades to their
            clinic or their school or the community water system.</p>

            <p class="panel-item-p">"An established organization with a long history of service in communities in dire
                need of
                support, MEDICO Teams have become the highlight of my year. Over the years I have met so many amazing
                selfless volunteers and formed friendships and bonds that will last a lifetime.
                I am constantly humbled by the outpouring of hospitality and kindness shown to us by the Honduran people
                and
                inspired by their sense of community and culture. Never short in demand, the Medical and Dental teams
                have
                been missed through the COVID epidemic and are needed now more than ever, and I am excited for the
                opportunity to serve as part of this amazing team."
